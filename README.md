# Semi-Supervised-Learning-Hands-on

Hi,<br>
This repository is my work on a university course project on __Semi Supervised Learning__.<br>

This project highlighted Semi Supervised Learning algorithms with different percent of unlabelled data. There were three algorithms used in this project for the experimentations –
1. Semi Supervised Self Training
2. Semi Supervised Ensemble
3. Unsupervised Pretraining
For Semi Supervised Self Training, five base machine learning algorithms were used to perform the experimentation and get a bigger sample of the metrics for the comparison. For Semi Supervised Ensemble, Majority Voting Classifier was used with a choice of one of two base learners. And finally, for Unsupervised Pretraining, an Autoencoder is used.
There are six different sets of unlabelled data – 0%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 90%, and 95%.
